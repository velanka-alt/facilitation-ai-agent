# gesia_all sample corpus

This folder stores text extracts (`.txt`) converted from the local anonymized originals.
Original binary files (pptx/xlsx/docx/pdf/ppt) are kept outside the repo.
Use `_index.csv` to locate samples by category, program, doc type, and time.

Notes:
- Slide- and sheet-level markers (`[Slide NN]`, `[Sheet NN]`) are added during extraction.
- Older `.ppt` and `.pdf` files use a lightweight string scrape; verify manually if you need exact fidelity.
