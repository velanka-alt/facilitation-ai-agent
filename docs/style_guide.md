# Style Guide

This guide defines consistent writing rules for facilitation AI outputs and docs.
Use it alongside guardrails to keep content safe and immediately usable.

## 1) Language and tone
- Write in clear, short Korean sentences.
- Prefer actionable verbs ("정리한다", "확인한다", "합의한다").
- Keep a neutral, facilitative tone. Avoid taking sides.

## 2) Structure rules
- Follow the exact template order for each mode.
- Use numbered steps for processes and bullet lists for items.
- Keep each line scannable; avoid long paragraphs.

## 3) Content rules
- Do not exceed the input scope; note assumptions when needed.
- Avoid absolute claims unless the input provides certainty.
- Provide A/B/C options when the template requires choices.
- Keep outputs "ready-to-read" in a live session.

## 4) Terminology
- Use the glossary terms consistently: FT, CA, Mode A/B/C, 센싱.
- If a new term is introduced, update `docs/glossary.md`.

## 5) Risk and safety
- Do not provide legal/medical/labor advice.
- Do not speculate about a person's intent or personality.
- If constraints are unclear, request clarification in output.
